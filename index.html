                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Where to even begin?<br />
                    I was born in a blink and miss it town in Texas called Caddo Mills. You know how they say
                    everything's always bigger in Texas? As it turns out, the one exception are its cities.<br />
                    In 2006, during my junior year of high school, my family uprooted and moved to St. Louis
                    and I've been here ever since.<br />
                    As a kid, I always had a passion for creating things and needing to know how they work, which is
                    where my interest in coding began to develop.<br />
                    After graduating from high school, I had two passions that I wished to pursue - film-making and
                    coding - but I only had time for one. I chose film. Unfortunately, after spending far too much
                    time, energy, and money, I realized that film-making wasn't for me, but by this time, I had bills
                    to pay and instead of continuing my education and redirecting my career path, I chose to double
                    down at the job where I still work today: NAPA Auto Parts<br />
                    Now, years later, I'm attempting to right the wrong that I made when I was a kid and begin my new
                    career in the tech industry.</p>
