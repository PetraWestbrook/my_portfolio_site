                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Where to even begin?<br />
                    I'm a simple gal. I was born in a blink and miss it town in Texas. You know how they say everything's
                    always bigger in Texas? Turns out one exception are the cities within.<br />
                    In 2006, during my junior year of high school, my family uprooted our life and moved to St. Louis and
                    we've been here ever since.<br />
                    Ever since I was a child I always had a penchant for creating things and a need to know how other
                    things work, which is where my desire to code began to blossom.</p>
